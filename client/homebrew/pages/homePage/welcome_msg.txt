# The Homebrewery
Welcome traveler from an antique land. Please sit and tell us of what you have seen. The unheard of monsters, who slither and bite. Tell us of the wondrous items and and artifacts you have found, their mysteries yet to be unlocked. Of the vexing vocations and surprising skills you have seen.

### Homebrew D&D made easy
The Homebrewery makes the creation and sharing of authentic looking Fifth-Edition homebrews easy. It uses [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) with a little CSS magic to make your brews come to life.

**Try it! **Simply edit the text on the left and watch it *update live* on the right.



### Editing and Sharing
When you create your own homebrew you will be given a *edit url* and a *share url*.  Any changes you make will be automatically saved to the database within a few seconds. Anyone with the edit url will be able to make edits to your homebrew. So be careful about who you share it with.

Anyone with the *share url* will be able to access a read-only version of your homebrew.

>##### PDF Exporting
> PDF Printing works best in Chrome. If you are having quality/consistency issues, try using Chrome to print instead.
>
> After clicking the "Print" item in the navbar a new page will open and a print dialog will pop-up.
> * Set the **Destination** to "Save as PDF"
> * Set **Paper Size** to "Letter"
> * If you are printing on A4 paper, make sure to have the "A4 page size snippet" in your brew
> * In **Options** make sure "Background Images" is selected.
> * Hit print and enjoy! You're done!
>
> If you want to save ink or have a monochrome printer, add the **Ink Friendly** snippet to your brew before you print

## New Things in v2.1.0!
What's new in the latest update? Check out the full changelog [here](/homebrew/changelog)

* **Spell Lists** Tweaking the Markdown lexer and parser, I can now do nested Markdown within HTML blocks. Which means the available syntax I can use has vastly increased. Spell Lists are just the first of many new elements.
* **Recently Viewed/Edited** The Homebrewery now remembers which brews you've been editing and viewing. Check the navbar to quickly jump around to these.
* **Print Command Capturing** Pressing ctrl+p/cmd+p on any edit or share page will now jump you straight to the print page. Much more intutive.


## V2 Overhaul
A lot of <i class='fa fa-heart'></i> has been put into version 2 of The Homebrewery. Here are the highlights:

* **A whole new look** The site has been re-built from the ground up!
* **Better editor and split pane** Syntax highlighting will make writing your brews even easier, and now you can customize how large your editor is.
* **More reliable rendering** Lots of work has been put into making the rendering more reliable, not just for web, but also for PDFs
* **PDF Printing on Chrome** You don't need to use Chrome Canary anymore!
* ** Performance Improvements** The site should load faster, save faster, and render large brews *much* faster.
* **Patreon page** If you like this tool and want to show some thanks you can [head here](https://www.patreon.com/stolksdorf).

# Appendix

### Not quite Markdown
Although the Homebrewery uses Markdown, to get all the styling features from the PHB, we had to get a little creative. Some base HTML elements are not used as expected and I've had to include a few new keywords.

___
* **Horizontal Rules** are generally used to *modify* existing elements into a different style. For example, a horizontal rule before a blockquote will give it the style of a Monster Stat Block instead of a note.
* **New Pages** are controlled by the author. It's impossible for the site to detect when the end of a page is reached, so indicate you'd like to start a new page, use the new page snippet to get the syntax.
* **Code Blocks** are used only to indicate column breaks. Since they don't allow for styling within them, they weren't that useful to use.
* **HTML** can be used to get *just* the right look for your homebrew. I've included some examples in the snippet icons above the editor.



### Images
Images can be included 'inline' with the text using Markdown-style images. However for background images more control is needed.

Background images should be included as HTML-style img tags. Using inline CSS you can precisely position your image where you'd like it to be. I have added both a inflow image snippet and a background image snippet to give you exmaples of how to do it.

```
```


### Legal Junk
You are free to use The Homebrewery is any way that you want, except for claiming that you made it yourself. If you wish to sell or in some way gain profit for what's created on this site, it's your responsibility to ensure you have the proper licenses/rights for any images or resources used.

### Crediting Me
If you'd like to credit The Homebrewery in your brew, I'd be flattered! Just reference that you made it with The Homebrewery.
