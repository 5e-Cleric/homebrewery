# NaturalCrit
A tool suite for DMs to use for D&D


### Getting started
1. Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Clone down the repo
1. In your terminal, head to the repo
1. Run `npm install` to get all the dependacies
1. Run `gulp fresh`, this will compile and build all the needed libraries (this only has to be done once, unless you add more libs)
1. Run `gulp` to run the project locally. Should be accessible at `localhost:8000`

**Notes:** I use Mongo as the database, so if you'd like to interact with that, make sure you have that installed.

Have fun!
